# Pre-Owned-Car-Price-Prediction

## Context
What determines the price of used cars? The value of a car drops right from the moment it is bought and the depreciation continues with each passing year. In fact, in the first year itself, the value of a car decreases by 20 percent of its initial value. The make and model of a car, total kilometers driven, overall condition of the vehicle and various other factors further affect the carâ€™s resale value [CarDekho](https://www.cardekho.com/used-car-valuation.htm).
